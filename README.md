This is the repo for my portfolio.

It contains basic layout and formatting elements garnered from Bootstrap, as well as additional formatting using CSS.

Images currently contained in the portfolio are placeholders for both my "professional image" and portfolio examples.

This is meant to be a "living" site and will be updated to include new elements as my knowledge level increases.
